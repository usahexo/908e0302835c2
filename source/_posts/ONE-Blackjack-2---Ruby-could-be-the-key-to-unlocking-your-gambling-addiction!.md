#  ONE Blackjack 2 - Ruby could be the key to unlocking your gambling addiction!

It's no secret that web development is one of the most in-demand skills in the world right now. Employers are always on the lookout for developers with Ruby skills, and with a median salary of $128,000, there's plenty of reasons to learn this powerful programming language.

If you're new to Ruby (or programming in general), don't worry - we're going to walk you through everything you need to get started. By the end of this article, you'll be able to create your own simple Ruby programs, and you'll have a basic understanding of how Ruby works.

Let's get started!

# What is Ruby?

Ruby is a powerful programming language that was first released in 1995. It quickly gained popularity due to its ease of use and readability, making it perfect for beginners. Ruby is an object-oriented language, which means that everything in Ruby is treated as an object. This makes Ruby code easy to read and understand.

Ruby also has a number of built-in features that make it perfect for web development. For example, it has a built-in HTML parser which makes it easy to generate HTML pages from within your Ruby code. It also supports server-side scripting, making it perfect for creating dynamic web applications.

# Installing Ruby

The best way to learn Ruby is by using a coding environment called rubymine. This is a free software package that includes all the tools you need to develop ruby applications. You can download rubymine from the official ruby website: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ .

Once you've installed rubymine, open it up and you'll see a screen like this:





















	 	 		 		We'll be using this screen throughout this tutorial - each time we run a new program or execute a command, we'll show you what it looks like inside rubymine. The first thing we need to do is install the ruby interpreter on our computer. To do this, open up your terminal (or command prompt) and type the following command: sudo apt install ruby-devOnce ruby is installed, we can start writing our first program!

#  How to spot signs of a gambling addiction

Gambling addiction can be difficult to spot, but there are some signs that can indicate a problem. If you’re worried about someone you know, here are some things to look for.

* Financial problems – gambling addicts often spend large amounts of money on gambling, which can lead to financial difficulties.

* secrecy and isolation – people with a gambling addiction may try to keep their problem a secret, and may isolate themselves from friends and family.

* changes in behaviour – gambling addicts may change their behaviour in order to hide their addiction, for example becoming aggressive or secretive.

* mood swings – people with a gambling addiction can often experience mood swings, as they swing between excitement and despair over their gambling habit.

* disinterest in usual activities – someone who is addicted to gambling may start to lose interest in activities they used to enjoy, as they focus more on their addiction.

If you think someone you know may have a gambling addiction, it’s important to talk to them about it. You could try suggesting they see a counsellor or seek help from a support group like Gamblers Anonymous.

#  What Precisely Does a Gambling Addiction Look Like?

Gambling addiction, also known as compulsive gambling, is a type of impulse-control disorder. This means that people with this disorder have difficulty resisting urges or impulses to do things that could be harmful to themselves or others.

People with gambling addiction often feel Like they can’t control their behavior and may gamble despite negative consequences such as debt, family problems, or job loss. They may also lie about their gambling or try to hide it from loved ones.

Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for the individual’s mental and physical health, wallet, and relationships.

Some signs that someone might have a gambling addiction include:


1) Feeling the need to gamble more and more money in order to achieve the desired effect;
2) Gambling when you can’t afford to lose money; 
3) Lying about how much money has been gambled or lost; 
4) Hiding gambling activity from loved ones; 
5) Excessive mood swings before, during, and after gambling; 
6) feeling restless or irritable when unable to gamble; 
7) Attempting to recoup losses by gambling even more money; 
8 ) Suffering from financial problems due to gambling debts; 
9) experiencing anxiety or depression as a result of gambling problems; and 
10) Having thoughts about committing suicide due to gambling problems.

#  5 early warning signs of gambling addiction

Most people think that gambling is a harmless pastime, but for some it can become a dangerous addiction. Here are 5 early warning signs of gambling addiction:

1. You can’t resist the urge to gamble

If you find yourself constantly thinking about gambling and feeling an urge to gamble, then you may be addicted. Gambling can be very addictive and can be hard to resist, especially if you’re having a bad day or are feeling stressed or anxious.

2. You’re losing money faster than you can afford to lose

If you find yourself regularly betting more money than you can afford to lose, then you may be addicted to gambling. Losing money can quickly become a cycle that’s difficult to break, and before you know it you may have lost a lot of money.

3. You’re hiding your gambling from family and friends

If you’re hiding your gambling from family and friends, then it may be because you’re ashamed of your addiction. Gambling can be a very secretive addiction, and many people who are addicted to gambling will go out of their way to keep it hidden from others.

4. You feel anxious or depressed when you can’t gamble

If you feel anxious or depressed when you can’t gamble, then this is another sign that you may be addicted. When you’re unable to gamble, you may feel like there’s something missing in your life and this can lead to feelings of anxiety or depression.

5. You lie about your gambling habit

If you find yourself lying about your gambling habit, then this is another sign that you may be addicted. Lying about how much money you’ve spent on gambling or hiding your gambling habit from others is not healthy and is often a sign that there is a problem.

#  Gambling addiction: What are the telltale signs?

If someone has a gambling addiction, there are usually some telltale signs. In fact, there are certain behaviors and patterns of behavior that are common in people who have a gambling addiction.

One sign of a gambling addiction is that the person will often times gamble more than they can afford to lose. They may also gamble even when they know they are going to lose money. Gambling addicts often have a "gambling problem" and will continue to gamble, even when it causes them financial, personal or relationship problems.

Other telltale signs of a gambling addiction include: being secretive about gambling activities, borrowing money from friends or family to gamble, lying about gambling losses, and feeling anxious or stressed when not able to gamble.
