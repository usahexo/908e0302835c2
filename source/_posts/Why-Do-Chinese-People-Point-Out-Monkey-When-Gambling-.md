#  Why Do Chinese People Point Out Monkey When Gambling? 

The Monkey is one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac calendar. People who are born in the year of the monkey (1932, 1944, 1956, 1968, 1980, 1992, 2004) are considered intelligent, flexible and versatile.

According to Chinese legend, the god of luck and prosperity named “Fu Lu Shou” was on his way to a party with three other gods when they encountered a group of monkeys blocking their path. The god Fu Lu Shou managed to make all the monkeys disappear and continued on his way to the party.

In honor of this story, people who are born in the year of the monkey are supposed to bring good luck and prosperity to those around them. This is why you often see Chinese people pointing out the monkey when gambling – they believe it will bring them good luck.

#  The Significance of Pointing Out the Monkey in Gambling 

It has been said that those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. In the world of gambling, it is important for players to be aware of the significant lessons from the past in order to make informed decisions that can lead to profits.

A prime example of this is the story of the monkey. Way back in 1892, a horse named George Smith was racing at a track in New Orleans when a monkey jumped into the race and grabbed the horse's jockey's whip. The whip snapped Smith out of his concentration, and he lost the race.

While there is no clear evidence that this story is true, it has become an infamous gambling legend. The moral of the story is that even the slightest disruption can ruin your chances of winning - something that players should keep in mind when they're betting on races or other sporting events.

In particular, punters need to be wary of outside factors such as weather conditions and injuries that could affect how a game unfolds. For example, if you're betting on a football match and one team is missing their best player, that's something you'll need to take into account when making your predictions.

Furthermore, you also need to be mindful of the fact that bookmakers often try to bias public opinion by setting odds that favour one side over another. This is why it's important to do your own research before placing any bets - otherwise you might find yourself getting caught up in all the hype and losing money in the process.

Of course, no one can predict with 100% certainty how a game will play out, but by being aware of the monkey in gambling, you'll be well on your way to making more informed bets and improving your chances of winning.

#  Monkey is the God of Luck in China 

The monkey is one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac. For many Chinese people, the monkey is not only a cute animal, but also the god of luck.

There are many legends about monkeys and luck. One story goes that a man had a terrible disease and no one could cure him. He went to a temple and prayed to the god of the temple for help. Suddenly, a monkey appeared and stole a medicine from the god’s altar. The man followed the monkey and recovered his health.

Another story tells of a poor farmer who had no money to pay his taxes. He prayed to the god of luck, and soon a monkey brought him some treasure. The farmer was able to pay his taxes and keep his farm.

Monkeys are said to be lucky because they are intelligent and agile, and they often find food in difficult places. In China, there are many statues and images of monkeys because people believe that they bring good luck.

#  Why do Chinese people believe that Monkey brings them good luck? 

There is an old saying in China that goes, “Monkey brings good luck.” 佬莎猴喜 (lǎoshā hóu xǐ), which literally means “Monkey brings happiness.” 

This expression comes from an ancient Chinese legend about a monkey who was said to have the power to bring good luck. 

The story goes that a long time ago, there was a village that suffered from a series of bad luck. The villagers were so desperate that they prayed to the gods for help. 

Suddenly, a magical monkey appeared and promised to help them. The monkey told the villagers that he could banish all of the bad luck if they would make him their king. 

The villagers were so happy to have their good luck returned that they agreed to make the monkey their king. And from then on, the people of the village believed that Monkey brought them good luck. 

Today, many Chinese people still believe that Monkey brings them good luck. This is because Monkey is seen as a symbol of happiness and good fortune.

#  How to Gamblers Boost their Luck by Pointing Out the Monkey

A recent study out of Nottingham Trent University found that when gamblers pointed out a monkey to another person at the casino, their luck improved. 
This is the first study of its kind to document this phenomenon.

The study participants were asked to play a game of chance while being watched by a researcher. They were also videotaped during their play. In some cases, the researcher pointed out a toy monkey that was placed in the playing area. In other cases, the toy monkey was not mentioned.

The results showed that when the toy monkey was pointed out, the players’ odds of winning increased significantly. Therefore, it would appear that pointing out the monkey can help boost your luck while gambling.

So what could be behind this strange finding? One possible explanation is that seeing the toy monkey triggers something in our brains that makes us more likely to win. It may also be due to superstition – we may think that because we noticed the monkey, it must be good luck.

Whatever the reason, if you want to gamble and want to give yourself a better chance of winning, point out the monkey!
