#  Where is Baccarat Crystal from FC Bayern Munich?

Baccarat Crystal is a French luxury crystal glass manufacturer, founded in 1764 by Louis-François Baccarat. It is located in the Lorraine region of France.

The company designs and manufactures lead glass and crystal glass tableware, ornaments, jewelry, and lighting.

Baccarat Crystal has been owned by the German club FC Bayern Munich since 2008. In that year, the club purchased a majority stake in the company from Scandinavian private equity firm EQT Partners. 

FC Bayern Munich has used Baccarat Crystal to create unique trophies for its players. These include the Bundesliga championship trophy, the DFB-Pokal (German Cup), and the Champions League trophy. 

The president of FC Bayern Munich, Uli Hoeneß, has said of the acquisition: "Baccarat is one of the most traditional brands in the world of luxury items and we are very proud to be able to add it to our portfolio." 

Baccarat Crystal remains an independent company, with its own management and board of directors. However, it has benefitted from being associated with FC Bayern Munich, as its global profile has been raised significantly in recent years.

A Brief History
Baccarat crystal is a type of high-quality crystal glassware that has been manufactured in the city of Baccarat, France, since the 18th century. In the early days, the glass was extremely expensive and only available to wealthy customers.
However, with the Industrial Revolution and the rise of new manufacturing techniques, Baccarat crystal became more widely available and affordable. Today, it is considered a prestigious item and is often used as a decoration or gift.

Types of Baccarat Crystal
There are many different types of Baccarat crystal, including wine glasses, champagne flutes, bowls, vases, and figurines. Each piece is unique and handcrafted by expert artisans.

The Manufacturing Process
Baccarat crystal is made using a traditional mouth-blown technique. Molten glass is poured into a metal mould called a punty, which is then attached to a blowpipe. The blowpipe is then inserted into the furnace and the glass is blown into shape.

The Finished Product
After being blown into shape, the glassware is placed on a rotating wheel where it is trimmed and polished by hand. This ensures that each piece is perfect in terms of size, shape, and clarity.

The Benefits of Buying Baccarat Crystal
There are many benefits to buying Baccarat crystal:
· It is made from high-quality materials and crafted with great attention to detail.
· It is durable and will last for many years if properly cared for.
· It has a luxurious look and feel that will enhance any setting.
