#  How does Greene's approach to MTT poker differ from other pros?

There are many different approaches that can be taken when playing MTT poker. But what makes Andrew "thew00d" Woods' approach particularly unique is his focus on aggression. Where many other pros might adopt a patient, wait-and-see strategy, Woods is much more likely to open up the pot preflop and put pressure on his opponents.

This approach can be risky, but it often pays off big dividends. By forcing his opponents to make difficult decisions and take risks, Woods can often get them to fold when they would otherwise call. This allows him to secure valuable pots without having to risk too much of his own chips.

While this approach may not work for everyone, it has proven successful for Woods time and time again. If you're looking to add a bit more aggression to your game, then it might be worth studying thew00d's techniques and seeing if you can apply them to your own gameplay.
