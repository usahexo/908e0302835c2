#  Former Tallahassee mayor Winston Reynolds sentenced to prison for gambling conviction

Former Tallahassee mayor and Florida state representative Winston Reynolds was sentenced to prison this week for his role in a gambling conspiracy. Reynolds, who had previously served as the mayor of Tallahassee from 1998 to 2003, was found guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and unlawful Internet gambling in February after being indicted in connection with an illegal online gambling operation.

Reynolds was sentenced to 33 months in prison on Monday, with federal prosecutors arguing that he should receive a longer sentence due to his "position of public trust." However, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Hinkle ultimately decided on a shorter sentence, noting that Reynolds had no prior criminal record and had already suffered professionally as a result of the case. In addition to his prison sentence, Reynolds was also ordered to pay $200,000 in restitution.

The 61-year-old Reynolds is the latest high-profile figure to be convicted as part of the government's crackdown on illegal online gambling. Other defendants in the case include Gilbert Chilton, the owner of offshore sports betting site BetOnSports, who was sentenced to seven years in prison last year.

Winston Reynolds, a well-known figure in the city of Cincinnati and convicted on gambling charges, issued a public apology to the city on Wednesday.

"I'm sorry for the pain and embarrassment I've caused," Reynolds said in a statement. "I know I've let down the people who have supported me for years. I'm committed to making things right and will work with the city to ensure that this doesn't happen again."

Reynolds, known for his involvement in youth athletics and charity work, was arrested last month as part of a sweeping investigation into illegal gambling in the city. He is one of more than two dozen people charged in connection with the probe.

Reynolds admitted to betting on college and pro games, but said he never placed bets with bookies or against his own teams.

"I know I made a mistake and I take full responsibility for my actions," Reynolds said. "I hope that through my actions I can show others that there are better ways to deal with problems than through gambling."

Reynolds attorney said his client looks forward to putting this behind him and moving on with his life.
