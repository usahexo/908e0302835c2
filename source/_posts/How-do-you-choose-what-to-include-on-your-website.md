#  How do you choose what to include on your website?

There are so many things you could include on your website, but you only have a limited amount of space and time. So how do you choose what to include?

One way is to think about what's important to your audience. What do they need or want to know? What's the most useful or interesting information for them?

Another way is to focus on what's unique about your business or organization. What makes you different from everyone else? Why should people visit your website instead of someone else's?

Finally, think about what can help you achieve your goals. What do you hope people will do when they visit your website? Buy something, sign up for a mailing list, contact you for more information? Whatever it is, make sure the content on your website supports those goals.

When putting together your website, it's important to keep in mind who your target audience is and what you want them to do when they visit. Choose content that is relevant and helpful to them, and that supports your business goals. With a little thought and planning, you can create a website that's both informative and effective.

#  How often should you update your website?

If you're like most business owners, you're probably asking yourself how often you should update your website. The answer to this question depends on a variety of factors including your industry, the age of your website, and how frequently you make changes to its content.

In general, it's a good idea to update your website at least once a month. This will ensure that your website is current and relevant, and it will also help you attract new visitors and keep current ones engaged. If you can't update your website on a monthly basis, then consider doing so at least every other month.

If your website is more than a year old or if it doesn't change very often, then you may need to update it more frequently. In some cases, you may even need to update it weekly or daily in order to keep up with the latest industry trends.

Of course, there are also times when you won't want to make any changes to your website. If you're releasing a new product or service, for example, then you may want to hold off on updating your website until after the launch has taken place.

Overall, it's important to remember that website updates should be done on a regular basis in order to keep your site looking fresh and engaging. By keeping your website updated regularly, you'll be able to improve its ranking in search engines, increase traffic levels, and boost sales and conversions.

#  What navigation tools work best for family historians?

There are a variety of navigation tools available to family historians. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it is important to choose the tool that will work best for your research needs.

One common navigational tool is the family tree. A family tree can help you visualize your family relationships and track your ancestors’ movements over time. However, creating a family tree can be time-consuming, and it can be difficult to find information on specific ancestors.

Another common tool is the timeline. A timeline can help you track events in your ancestor’s life and see how they are related to other events. However, creating a timeline can also be time-consuming, especially if you want to include detailed information about each event.

A third option is a genealogy database. A genealogy database allows you to search for ancestors by name and view their records online. However, not all databases include records for every ancestor, and some databases are fee-based.

Which navigation tool is best for you depends on your research needs and budget. If you are looking for a broad overview of your family history, a family tree or timeline may be the best option. If you are looking for specific information about an ancestor, a genealogy database may be the best option. No matter which tool you choose, be sure to spend some time getting familiar with it before starting your research!
