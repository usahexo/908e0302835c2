To get ready for the opening of the Poker Room and make sure that you're one of the lucky few able to take part in all the fun, we've put together this guide on how to get prepared!

1. Know the Rules

Before you even think about sitting down at a table, it's important that you know the basic rules of poker. There are many variations of the game, but the basics are always the same. Familiarize yourself with the different hands (Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House etc.), as well as how betting works. The last thing you want is to be left out because you don't understand what's going on!

2. Join an Online Poker League or Tournament

If you're not quite ready to take on real-life players just yet, why not try your hand at some online tournaments? There are plenty of sites where you can test your skills against other players from around the world. Not only will this help improve your game, but it'll also give you a bit of experience in high-pressure situations. Who knows - maybe you'll even end up winning big!

3. Practice Makes Perfect!

The best way to prepare for any game is to practice as much as possible. Poker is no exception! If you can find a few people who are willing to sit down and play with you regularly, that's ideal. But if not, don't worry - there are plenty of online poker games that you can join in on too. Just make sure that you're playing with actual money stakes so that you can get used to handling real-life bets.
