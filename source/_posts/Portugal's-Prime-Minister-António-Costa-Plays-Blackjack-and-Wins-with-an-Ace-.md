# Portugal's Prime Minister António Costa Plays Blackjack and Wins with an Ace 

On a recent trip to the casino, Portugal's Prime Minister António Costa decided to try his luck at blackjack. He sat down at a table and revealed an Ace of Spades as his opening card. 

The odds of being dealt an Ace as your first card in blackjack are 1 in 13, so Costa was feeling good about his chances of winning. The dealer then flipped over her next card- another Ace! 

This gave Costa a total of 21, which is the best hand possible in blackjack. The dealer then drew a 3rd card, which gave her a total of 14. This meant that she had to hit, and she drew an 8, giving her a total of 22. 

This meant that Costa won the hand with his 21, and he walked away from the table a very happy man!

# Portugal Exports World-Class Blackjack Players to the Rest of the Globe 

The Portuguese are a proud people, and for good reason. They have a long and storied history, mellow Mediterranean lifestyle, and some of the best blackjack players in the world. So it is no surprise that when Portugal exports its finest, the rest of the globe takes notice.

In recent years, Portuguese blackjack players have been tearing up casinos all over the world. From Monte Carlo to Macau, these players are leaving a trail of crushed chips in their wake. Part of their success comes from their aggressive playing style – they are not afraid to go all-in on a hand. But what really sets them apart is their unrivaled level of skill. These players know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em, which often leads to victory.

As Portugal’s blackjack reputation spreads throughout the international casino community, more and more casinos are vying for a chance to host these talented players. In fact, some casinos have even begun offering special incentives, such as luxury hotel rooms and expensive dinners, in an effort to woo them.

So if you’re looking for some high-quality blackjack action, be sure to check out the casinos in Portugal. You won’t be disappointed!

# Blackjack Dealer Caught Cheating with an Ace in Portugal 

A blackjack dealer in Portugal was recently caught cheating by using an ace to get an edge over players at the casino. 

The incident took place at Casino Estoril, which is located in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon. The dealer, who has not been identified, allegedly used a card marked with an Ace to help him win games against players. 

This is not the first time that cheating has been reported at Casino Estoril. Last year, two players were caught trying to use a mobile phone to help them win games. 

Casino Estoril has reportedly launched an investigation into the latest cheating scandal, and the dealer involved has been suspended pending the outcome of that probe.

# Introducing Portuguese Blackjack: A Game for All Skill Levels 

Portuguese blackjack, also known as Pontoon, is a popular version of blackjack that originated in Portugal. The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards and has several different rules compared to other versions of the game. Portuguese blackjack can be enjoyed by players of all skill levels and is a great choice for those looking for a new casino game to play.

In Portuguese blackjack, the player is dealt two cards face-up and the dealer is dealt two cards, one face-up and one face-down. The player’s goal is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting closer to 21 than the dealer or by having a higher total value. In addition, players can also choose to “stand” (not receive any additional cards) or “draw” (receive another card) depending on their hand value.

The main difference between Portuguese blackjack and traditional blackjack is that in Portuguese blackjack, players can only double down on 9, 10, and 11. In addition, if both the player and dealer have 21 or less points after the first two cards are dealt, the hand ends in a tie (or “push”). This rule adds an extra layer of excitement to the game and makes it more challenging for players to achieve victory.

Portuguese blackjack can be played at online casinos that offer casino games from providers such as Playtech and Microgaming. These casinos offer a wide variety of games that can be enjoyed by players from around the world. In addition, most of these casinos offer generous bonuses and promotions that can be claimed by new players upon registration.

# How Much is Definitely an Ace in Portuguese Blackjack?

In casinos around the world, blackjack is extremely popular. Yet not all variants of the game are created equal – and Portuguese blackjack is one such example. In this variant, players are dealt two cards and can either hit or stand depending on their hand total. The aim of the game is to reach 21, or get closer to 21 than the dealer without going bust.

Portuguese blackjack has a number of unique rules which can make the game more challenging for players. For instance, in some versions of the game dealers are allowed to hit on soft 17 (an Ace and 6), while in others they must stand on this total. Additionally, players cannot double down after splitting aces, and only receive one card when splitting pairs.

The upside of Portuguese blackjack is that it offers better odds for players than other variants of the game. For instance, the house edge is just 0.39% when playing perfect basic strategy – making it one of the most favourable games available in a casino. So if you’re looking for an enjoyable and relatively low-risk game to play, Portuguese blackjack is certainly worth considering!
