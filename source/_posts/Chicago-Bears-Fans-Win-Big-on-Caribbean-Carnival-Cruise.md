#  Chicago Bears Fans Win Big on Caribbean Carnival Cruise

Chicago Bears fans looking for a football-themed vacation destination didn’t have to look much further than the Caribbean Carnival cruise. This cruise featured an all-Bears fan itinerary that included a pre-cruise party in Miami, special meetups with Bears alumni and cheerleaders, and a post-cruise bash in Las Vegas.

The celebration kicked off with a pep rally at Miami’s Bayfront Park, where fans had the opportunity to get autographs from former Bears players like Jim McMahon and Richard Dent, as well as members of the current team’s coaching staff. The fun continued on the ship, where fans could watch every Bears game in one of the three dedicated viewing areas or participate in themed events like the “Super Bowl Shuffle” dance contest.

The highlight of the trip was definitely the final night, when over 1,000 Bears fans descended on Sin City for a private party at Caesar’s Palace. There was plenty of food, drink, and entertainment to go around, including appearances by current players and alumni. Chicagoans certainly know how to throw a party!

#  Chicago Bears Fans Gamble and Win on Caribbean Carnival Cruise

Chicago Bears fans have a lot to celebrate this year. Not only did their favorite team make it to the Super Bowl, but many of them are also reaping the benefits of a Caribbean cruise they won in a gambling contest.

The cruise was part of a promotion run by the Chicago Bears' official casino partner, 888Sport. The contest asked Bears fans to predict the outcome of all 16 regular season games, with the grand prize being a free cruise for two.

Hundreds of people entered, but only one walked away with the prize. That lucky fan was 39-year-old Kim Wojcik, who correctly guessed 15 out of 16 games.

"I'm still in shock," said Wojcik after learning she'd won. "I never expected to actually win."

Despite not winning the Super Bowl, Chicago Bears fans can still feel like champions by taking a free Caribbean cruise. And who knows? Maybe next year they'll bring home the Lombardi Trophy as well.
