#  Clinton favored, but Sanders could still pull upset

The Iowa caucus is Monday, and Hillary Clinton is the favorite, but Bernie Sanders could still pull off an upset.

Clinton has a lead in the polls, but her advantage is not as large as it once was. And Sanders has momentum after winning New Hampshire.

If turnout is high, Sanders could win. He has much more enthusiastic supporters than Clinton.

Clinton's biggest advantage is that she is better organized and has more experience in running campaigns. She also has the backing of most of the Democratic Party establishment.

Sanders is appealing to young voters and independents, and he has strong support among liberals.

The big question is whether Sanders can attract enough support from black and Hispanic voters to win.

#  Johnson could play spoiler in tight race

Minnesota’s 3rd Congressional District is one of the most closely watched in the country, with incumbent Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson and Republican challenger Dave Hughes locked in a tight race.

But as the campaign enters its final days, a wildcard has emerged: Jeff Johnson, the Republican former governor who narrowly lost to Democrat Tim Walz in the 2018 race for governor.

A recent New York Times/Siena College poll shows that Johnson could play spoiler in the race, taking votes away from Hughes and helping Peterson win re-election.

The poll found that 19 percent of voters were undecided, and that Peterson had a 5-point lead over Hughes among those who said they were definitely going to vote. But when Johnson was included in the mix, Peterson’s lead shrinks to 2 points, with Hughes at 44 percent and Peterson at 42 percent.

Johnson insists he’s not running to help Peterson, but his presence in the race appears to be benefiting the incumbent congressman.

“I’m not trying to help Collin Peterson; I’m trying to beat Collin Peterson,” Johnson told reporters earlier this month. “But if people are so disillusioned with both parties that they either stay home or they vote for me, then I think that would be good for Minnesotans.”

Peterson has been in Congress since 1991, and is one of the most conservative Democrats in the House. He frequently breaks with his party on key issues, voting with Republicans on issues like gun rights and abortion.

Hughes has made it a priority to unseat Peterson, targeting the congressman’s record on spending and taxes. He has also criticized Peterson for not doing more to bring jobs to the district.

The 3rd Congressional District includes 10 counties in western Minnesota, including Minneapolis suburbs and rural areas near Lake Superior. It has been a Republican-leaning district in recent years, but Hughes faces an uphill battle against an incumbent who is popular among rural voters.

#  Trump gaining on Clinton, but still faces long odds

> Despite a stream of bad news for Donald Trump in recent weeks, the Republican nominee has narrowed the gap with Hillary Clinton, but still faces long odds of winning the election in November, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll.

> The survey, released on Tuesday, showed that 42 percent of likely voters supported Clinton while 38 percent backed Trump. Clinton has held a comfortable lead in the polls for months, but Trump has been drawing more support from Republicans in recent weeks.

> The poll also found that about 22 percent of likely voters said they would not support either candidate. That figure was down from about 30 percent earlier this year.

> James Henson, director of the University of Texas’ Texas Politics Project, said Trump’s rise in the polls since early August was due largely to Republicans coming home to their party nominee.

> “The reason he’s narrowed it is because people have decided that they don’t like either one of these candidates but they like Trump less bad than they like Hillary,” Henson said.

#  New poll shows dead heat in Pennsylvania

.

A new poll released by Franklin and Marshall College on Wednesday shows Republican Gov. Tom Corbett and Democratic challenger Tom Wolf in a dead heat, with each receiving the support of 46 percent of registered voters.

.

The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points, meaning that the two candidates are essentially statistically tied.

.

"This race is still up for grabs," said G. Terry Madonna, Ph.D., director of Franklin & Marshall's Keystone Polling Service and professor of public affairs at the college. "Governor Corbett has not broken 50 percent yet and he has a lot of work to do between now and November."

.

Corbett's poor approval ratings — only 38 percent approve of the job he is doing as governor, while 55 percent disapprove — may be working against him, Madonna said. Wolf's favorability ratings are also underwater, but not as badly as Corbett's: 37 percent view him favorably, while 31 percent have an unfavorable opinion.

#  Five key states to watch on Election Day

As Americans head to the polls to cast their ballots in the 2018 midterm elections, here are five key states to watch.

1. Texas: The state has been a Republican stronghold for years, but Democrats are hoping to make inroads in the Lone Star State this year. The race between incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke is one of the most closely watched contests in the country.

2. Georgia: Like Texas, Georgia has been a Republican stronghold in recent years. However, Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams could be on track to become the first black female governor in the United States if she wins on Tuesday.

3. Pennsylvania: The race for Pennsylvania’s 18th district is one of the most closely watched House races in the country. The seat became vacant after longtime Republican incumbent Tim Murphy resigned following allegations that he had an extramarital affair. Democrat Conor Lamb and Republican Rick Saccone are battling it out for the seat.

4. California: With all 53 seats up for grabs, California is a key battleground state in the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats are looking to win back control of the House of Representatives by picking up as many seats as possible in California.

5. Minnesota: Although it is typically a blue state, Minnesota is seen as a toss-up state this year. The race between incumbent Democratic Senator Tina Smith and her Republican challenger Karin Housley is one to watch on Election Day.
