      Cardinals Overcome Diamondbacks for National League Central Crown

        <h1 id="Cardinals-Overcome-Diamondbacks-for-National-League-Central-Crown"><a href="#Cardinals-Overcome-Diamondbacks-for-National-League-Central-Crown" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals Overcome Diamondbacks for National League Central Crown"></a>Cardinals Overcome Diamondbacks for National League Central Crown</h1><p>The Cardinals overcame the Diamondbacks to win the National League Central crown. This was a very tight division race, but the Cardinals pulled ahead in the end.</p>
<p>The Cardinals got off to a great start, thanks in part to their strong bullpen. However, the Diamondbacks made a late-season push and narrowly missed overtaking the Cardinals for first place.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Cardinals’ experience and depth carried them to victory. They will now move on to face the Dodgers in the National League Division Series.</p>
<h1 id="Brewers-Slip-to-Third-in-NL-Central-After-Late-Season-Struggles"><a href="#Brewers-Slip-to-Third-in-NL-Central-After-Late-Season-Struggles" class="headerlink" title="Brewers Slip to Third in NL Central After Late Season Struggles"></a>Brewers Slip to Third in NL Central After Late Season Struggles</h1><p>Just a month ago, the Milwaukee Brewers were in first place in the National League Central Division, but they have since fallen to third after a late season slump. The Brewers have lost eight of their last ten games and now sit six games behind the Chicago Cubs.</p>
<p>Milwaukee’s offense has been one of the worst in baseball over the past few weeks. They are averaging just 2.7 runs per game during their losing streak and have scored more than three runs only once in their last ten contests. Christian Yelich has been one of the only bright spots for the Brewers lately, batting .362 with six home runs and 18 RBI over his last ten games.</p>
<p>While the offense has struggled, the bullpen has been even worse. The Brewers bullpen has an ERA of 5.82 over their last ten games and has allowed at least four runs in six of those contests. Corey Knebel has been particularly bad, allowing eight runs in his last two appearances.</p>
<p>If the Brewers hope to make a run at the playoffs, they will need to improve both their offense and bullpen soon.</p>
<h1 id="Cubs-Clinch-Second-Place-in-NL-Central-With-Strong-Finish"><a href="#Cubs-Clinch-Second-Place-in-NL-Central-With-Strong-Finish" class="headerlink" title="Cubs Clinch Second Place in NL Central With Strong Finish"></a>Cubs Clinch Second Place in NL Central With Strong Finish</h1><p>The Cubs finished the season in strong fashion, clinching second place in the NL Central with a record of 92-70. This was a big accomplishment for the young Cubs team, as they battled through injuries and lack of experience en route to their first winning season in five years.</p>
<p>Led by their young core of players, including Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo, and Javier Baez, the Cubs were one of the most exciting teams in baseball to watch this year. They will look to build on this success next season and make a run for the playoffs.</p>
<p>In addition to their talented core of players, the Cubs also boast one of the best farm systems in baseball. Players such as Addison Russell, Kyle Schwarber, and Albert Almora Jr. are all waiting in the wings and could make an impact for the Cubs next season.</p>
<p>Overall, the future is bright for the Chicago Cubs and fans can expect great things from this team in years to come.</p>
<h1 id="Pirates-End-Season-on-Down-Note-Fall-to-Fourth-in-NL-Central"><a href="#Pirates-End-Season-on-Down-Note-Fall-to-Fourth-in-NL-Central" class="headerlink" title="Pirates End Season on Down Note, Fall to Fourth in NL Central"></a>Pirates End Season on Down Note, Fall to Fourth in NL Central</h1><p>The Pittsburgh Pirates finished the 2017 season on a down note, losing to the Cincinnati Reds 6-2 on Sunday. The Pirates now fall to fourth in the NL Central, one game behind the Milwaukee Brewers.</p>
<p>The Pirates got off to a hot start this season, but have since cooled off. They finish the season with a record of 78-83.</p>
<p>While they didn’t make the playoffs, there were some positives to take away from the 2017 season. Starling Marte had a strong year at the plate, finishing with a .311 batting average and 19 home runs. Josh Harrison also had a good year, hitting .290 with 16 homers and 85 RBIs.</p>
<p>Gregory Polanco had an up-and-down season but ultimately showed signs of improvement in the second half. He hit .258 with 22 homers and 86 RBIs on the year.</p>
<p>Ivan Nova was one of the few bright spots on the pitching staff, posting a 3.06 ERA in 33 starts. He was also one of only two Pirates pitchers to notch over 200 innings pitched this season (the other being Gerrit Cole).</p>
<p>The bullpen was another area of concern for Pittsburgh this season. Closer Tony Watson struggled after being traded to Los Angeles Dodgers, while setup man Daniel Hudson had an abysmal year (5.22 ERA). Overall, Pittsburgh’s bullpen finished with a 4.11 ERA, which was 25th in MLB.</p>
<p>The Pirates will look to improve in these areas for next season as they aim to make another run at the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Reds-Miss-Playoffs-as-They-Struggle-Late-in-the-Year"><a href="#Reds-Miss-Playoffs-as-They-Struggle-Late-in-the-Year" class="headerlink" title="Reds Miss Playoffs as They Struggle Late in the Year"></a>Reds Miss Playoffs as They Struggle Late in the Year</h1><p>It was a disappointing ending to the season for the Cincinnati Reds as they missed out on the playoffs for the first time since 2010. The team got off to a hot start and was in first place as late as July, but they went just 15-32 in September and October to fall out of contention.</p>
<p> Many factors played into their late-season collapse, including injuries to key players such as Joey Votto and Eugenio Suarez, as well as poor pitching and hitting down the stretch. There were also some clubhouse issues that cropped up, with several players reportedly not getting along well.</p>
<p>The Reds are now faced with some big questions heading into the offseason. First and foremost is what to do with All-Star outfielder Billy Hamilton, who is a free agent and likely to sign a lucrative contract elsewhere. They’ll also need to decide whether to bring back manager Bryan Price, who is under contract for one more year but could be in danger of being fired after another disappointing season.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a frustrating year for the Reds fan base. There were some highs early in the season, but it ultimately ended in disappointment. The team needs to make some major improvements if they want to compete again next year.</p>
