The most common are familysearch.org, ancestry.com, and findmypast.com.</p>
<p>Familysearch is a free resource offered by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It contains billions of records from over 130 countries. Ancestry is a subscription-based website that has the largest collection of genealogical data in the world. It includes records from the United States and other countries. FindMyPast is also a subscription-based website with records from the United Kingdom and other European countries.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-finding-your-family-tree"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-finding-your-family-tree" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of finding your family tree?"></a>What are the benefits of finding your family tree?</h1><p>There are many benefits to finding your family tree. One of the most obvious benefits is that you can learn more about your ancestors. This can give you a better understanding of your family history and why certain things are important to you.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that you may be able to find new family members. This can be especially exciting if you are looking for siblings or other relatives that you have never met before.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that you may be able to find out more about your health. If any of your relatives have had health problems in the past, learning about them could help you identify any potential health concerns that you may have as well.</p>
<p>Finally, another benefit of finding your family tree is that it can be a great way to connect with your heritage. This can be really important if you are not from a large family or if your family has moved away from where they are originally from.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-get-started-on-finding-your-family-tree"><a href="#How-do-you-get-started-on-finding-your-family-tree" class="headerlink" title="How do you get started on finding your family tree?"></a>How do you get started on finding your family tree?</h1><p>Before you start your family tree, there are a few things you should do to get organized and make the process easier.</p>
<p>_First, gather as much information as you can about your family._This includes birth and death certificates, marriage licenses, military records, census data, obituaries, and any other documents that could help you trace your family tree. If you don’t have any of this information, try talking to your older relatives or friends who might know more about your family history.</p>
<p>_Second, create a family tree diagram or chart._This will help you visualize your family’s genealogy and track down relationships between different members of your family. There are many different ways to create a family tree diagram, so find one that works best for you.</p>
<p>_Finally, start researching your family history._This can be challenging but it’s also fascinating and can provide a lot of insight into who you are and where you come from. Try using online resources like ancestry.com or google search to get started. You can also check out local libraries or historical societies for more information.</p>
<p>By following these steps, you’ll be well on your way to finding out more about your family history and building your very own family tree!</p>

</li>
<li><p>Be sure to check out local archives and libraries as well. Many times they will have records on microfilm or even in digital formats that you can access from your home computer.</p>
