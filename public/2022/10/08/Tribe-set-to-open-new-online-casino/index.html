<h1 id="Spirit-of-the-Stake-tribe-wins-big-in-online-gaming"><a href="#Spirit-of-the-Stake-tribe-wins-big-in-online-gaming" class="headerlink" title="Spirit of the Stake: tribe wins big in online gaming"></a>Spirit of the Stake: tribe wins big in online gaming</h1><p>The spirit of the stake is a way of life for some in the online gaming world. The tribe has won big, and they’re not about to give it up.</p>
<p>Back in the day, tribes were prominent in many online games. They were essential for forming alliances and dominating other players. In fact, tribes were so important that entire games were designed around them. Nowadays, however, they seem to be a thing of the past. Or are they?</p>
<p>Recently, after a long absence from the limelight, tribes have been making a comeback in several popular online games. One of these games is Fortnite, where tribes are now being used to take down high-level competition. What’s even more impressive is that some of these tribes have only been around for a few weeks!</p>
<p>How do these tribes manage to outperform others so quickly? The answer lies in their organization and coordination. Each member knows their role and what is expected of them. This allows them to move quickly and efficiently as a team, taking down anyone who gets in their way.</p>
<p>So if you want to join a top tribe in your favorite online game, what should you do? Here are some tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Join an existing tribe or create your own. There are already plenty of tribes out there, so finding one shouldn’t be too difficult. If you can’t find one that suits your needs, then start your own! Just make sure you have enough members to get started.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose the right game. Not all games are conducive to tribes formations. For example, strategy games like Starcraft or Civilization are not ideal because they require too much individual micromanagement. Games like League of Legends or Team Fortress 2, on the other hand, are perfect for tribes because they rely more on teamwork than individual skill.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get organized! Once you’ve found a tribe or created your own, the next step is to get organized. This means establishing rules and guidelines for how the tribe will operate. Everyone needs to be on the same page if you want to be successful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Practice! Like any other skill, becoming good at playing with a tribe requires practice. Play together as often as possible so that everyone becomes comfortable working with each other. This will help you when it comes time to take on tougher competition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Casino-War-Tribe-looks-to-conquer-digital-gaming-world"><a href="#Casino-War-Tribe-looks-to-conquer-digital-gaming-world" class="headerlink" title="Casino War: Tribe looks to conquer digital gaming world"></a>Casino War: Tribe looks to conquer digital gaming world</h1><p>In the early days of online casino gambling, only the most daring Tribal casinos dared venture into the new digital gaming world. Those that did quickly found themselves at the top of the industry, as they were able to cater to a player base that was looking for more excitement and authenticity than could be found at state-run gambling websites.</p>
<p>Now, almost 20 years later, Tribal casinos are leading the way once again, this time in the development and deployment of blockchain-based gaming platforms. While many other industries have embraced blockchain technology and seen dramatic increases in efficiency and security as a result, the gaming world has been slow to catch on. Tribes are now looking to change that, with several launching their own platforms in recent months.</p>
<p>One such platform is Indigenous Gaming by the Chickasaw Nation. The Chickasaw Nation is a federally-recognized Tribe located in central Oklahoma. The tribe operates one of the largest and most successful casino operations in the country, generating over $1 billion in revenue each year. With their new gaming platform, they are looking to bring that success to the blockchain gaming world.</p>
<p>The Chickasaw Nation’s Indigenous Gaming platform is built on top of Ethereum’s blockchain network. That allows for secure player authentication and fraud prevention, as well as fast and cheap transactions. The platform also uses smart contracts to automate game play and payments, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries. This not only reduces costs but also ensures that players receive their payments faster and without risk of fraud or chargebacks.</p>
<p>Other tribes are taking similar approaches to blockchain gaming development. The Tulalip Tribes of Washington State recently launched TahoeDGE (Tulalip Digital Gaming Estate), a platform that allows players to bet on sporting events and casino games using Tulalip’s own cryptocurrency, TULA. Like Indigenous Gaming, TahoeDGE uses smart contracts to automate transactions and reduce costs. It also offers a secure player authentication system that prevents cheating and identity theft.</p>
<p>The Mohegan Sun Pocono resort in Pennsylvania has also launched its own blockchain gaming platform called PlayMohegan. Unlike TahoeDGE or Indigenous Gaming, PlayMohegan does not use its own cryptocurrency; instead it uses Bitcoin Cash for all transactions. This allows players from around the world to easily participate in games without having to first exchange their currency into TULA or Bitcoin Cash.</p>
<p>While there are still some skeptics who doubt that blockchain technology can be used effectively in the gaming world, it is clear that Tribes are moving ahead with development nonetheless. With increased efficiency, security, and transparency offered by blockchain technology, it is likely that more Tribal casinos will launch their own platforms in the coming months and years</p>
