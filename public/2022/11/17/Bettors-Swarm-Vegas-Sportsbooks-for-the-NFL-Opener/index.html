      Bettors Swarm Vegas Sportsbooks for the NFL Opener

        <h1 id="Bettors-Swarm-Vegas-Sportsbooks-for-the-NFL-Opener"><a href="#Bettors-Swarm-Vegas-Sportsbooks-for-the-NFL-Opener" class="headerlink" title="Bettors Swarm Vegas Sportsbooks for the NFL Opener"></a>Bettors Swarm Vegas Sportsbooks for the NFL Opener</h1><p>The National Football League’s 2017-2018 season began on September 6 with a clash between the reigning Super Bowl champions, the New England Patriots, and the Kansas City Chiefs. And while the game may have been a blowout (the Pats won 42-27), it was nonetheless a popular one at Nevada’s sportsbooks.</p>
<p>According to figures released by the Gaming Control Board, bettors wagered a total of $158.5 million on NFL games in September, setting a new record for monthly betting volume. The figure was up from $149.8 million wagered in September of last year, and represented a 10 percent increase over the previous high mark of $143.5 million set in March of this year.</p>
<p>Football is easily the most popular sport for betting in the United States, and interest in this year’s NFL season has been especially high due to the excitement surrounding some of the league’s marquee teams (e.g., the Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers). In addition, there are several new head coaches this season (including Jon Gruden with the Raiders and Matt Patricia with the Lions), giving bettors additional opportunities to make informed wagers.</p>
<p>The jump in betting volume was seen across all segments of Nevada’s sports betting market. In terms of amounts wagered, football accounted for 36 percent of all bets placed on sports in September; basketball was second at 17 percent, while baseball came in third at 14 percent. And when it comes to individual sportsbooks, Caesar’s Palace took in the most money ($32.9 million) thanks largely to its large number of football betting options, including point spreads, totals, and moneylines.</p>
<h1 id="How-Sports-Gambling-is-Affecting-the-Las-Vegas-Casino-Industry"><a href="#How-Sports-Gambling-is-Affecting-the-Las-Vegas-Casino-Industry" class="headerlink" title="How Sports Gambling is Affecting the Las Vegas Casino Industry"></a>How Sports Gambling is Affecting the Las Vegas Casino Industry</h1><p>The casino industry in Las Vegas is facing an uncertain future as the legalization of sports gambling nationwide threatens to take a massive bite out of their profits. With Las Vegas already struggling to compete with other destinations in the face of declining tourism, the impact of legalized sports gambling could be devastating.</p>
<p>Casinos have long benefited from the prohibition on sports betting, as it has forced gamblers to turn to them as their only option for placing wagers. This has allowed casinos to charge high fees and offer poor odds, which has resulted in billion-dollar profits. But with sports gambling now legal in most states, casino operators are concerned that many of these gamblers will choose to place their bets elsewhere.</p>
<p>This is already beginning to happen, as more and more states legalize sports betting. In New Jersey, for example, casino revenue declined by 3.6% in 2018, largely due to the rise of online sports gambling. Nevada, meanwhile, saw its casino revenue decline by 2.5% in 2018, with experts predicting that the trend will continue going forward.</p>
<p>This threatens to have a particularly significant impact on Las Vegas, which has reaped the benefits of legalized gambling more than any other city in America. The city’s casinos generated nearly $250 million in revenue from sports betting in 2017, accounting for more than one-third of all such revenue nationwide. If this figure begins to decline significantly, it could be a major blow to the city’s economy.</p>
<p>Casino operators are hoping that they can stem this tide by getting involved in the sports betting industry themselves. But this is likely to be a challenging proposition, as online betting companies have a significant head start and are well-equipped to handle the increased demand. Casino operators may also find themselves playing catch-up when it comes to regulation and compliance, which could add further costs and complexity to their operations.</p>
<p>In light of all this uncertainty, casino operators are preparing for a future where sports betting takes a significant chunk out of their profits. This may mean scaling back their investments in Las Vegas or even abandoning the city entirely. Whatever happens, it is clear that legalized sports gambling represents a major threat to the Las Vegas casino industry</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Gamble-on-Sports-and-Win"><a href="#How-to-Gamble-on-Sports-and-Win" class="headerlink" title="How to Gamble on Sports and Win"></a>How to Gamble on Sports and Win</h1><p>Betting on sports is one of the most popular forms of gambling. In fact, in some countries like the UK, it is considered a national pastime. But there are a lot of people who make this form of gambling much more difficult than it needs to be. Just like any other form of gambling, if you know what you’re doing and make smart bets, you can make a lot of money.</p>
<p>The key to successful sports betting is to find value in the odds. This means finding bets where the odds are skewed in your favour - even if by just a little bit. There are a few different ways to do this. </p>
<p>One way is to bet on matchups between teams that are evenly matched. In these cases, the odds are often close to 50/50, so finding bets with good value can be tricky. However, if you do your research and know which team is likely to win, you can make a lot of money by betting against them at better-than-even odds. </p>
<p>Another way to find good value bets is by looking at underdogs. In most cases, the odds for an underdog winning are significantly higher than they should be. So if you have a feeling that an underdog is going to pull off an upset, this is a great way to get good value on your bet. </p>
<p>Of course, nothing is guaranteed in life, including sports betting. But if you follow these tips and play smart, you stand a much better chance of making money rather than losing it.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Sports-Books-Facing-Uncertain-Future-in-the-Age-of-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Sports-Books-Facing-Uncertain-Future-in-the-Age-of-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Sports Books Facing Uncertain Future in the Age of Online Gambling"></a>Nevada Sports Books Facing Uncertain Future in the Age of Online Gambling</h1><p>Just a few years ago, the Nevada sports book industry was thriving. However, in the age of online gambling, that is no longer the case.</p>
<p>The amount of money wagered on sports in Nevada has steadily decreased over the past few years. In 2016, sports betting revenues totaled just $2.34 billion, down from a high of $3.6 billion in 2007.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this decline is the fact that many people are now choosing to gamble online instead of going to a casino or sports book. This is due to the convenience and ease of online gambling, as well as the fact that it often offers better odds than traditional sports betting.</p>
<p>As a result, many Nevada casinos and sports books are struggling financially. This was made evident earlier this year when Wynn Resorts announced it was closing its sports book at its Las Vegas property.</p>
<p>While there is still money to be made in the Nevada sports book industry, it is clear that it is no longer as lucrative as it once was. This could lead more casinos and sports books to close their doors in the coming years.</p>
<h1 id="Can-Casinos-Survive-Without-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Can-Casinos-Survive-Without-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Can Casinos Survive Without Sports Betting?"></a>Can Casinos Survive Without Sports Betting?</h1><p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) recently released a report that shows casino revenue from sports betting has increased from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $2.9 billion in 2018. This is a 155% increase in just one year. In order to put this number into perspective, casino revenue from all other forms of gambling only increased by 7%. With this kind of growth, it’s no wonder the AGA is pushing for the legalization of sports betting on a federal level.</p>
<p>But will casinos be able to maintain this level of growth without sports betting?</p>
<p>It’s doubtful.</p>
<p> legalized sports betting can create an entirely new market for casinos. For example, the AGA report cites that there are 33 million Americans who identify as “occasional bettors”. These are people who only bet on one or two sporting events per year. If casinos can get these people to start betting more often, they would see a significant increase in revenue.</p>
<p>In addition, many people only bet on major sporting events, like the Super Bowl or March Madness. This leaves the door open for casinos to offer prop bets and other wagers on smaller sporting events that people might not normally bet on. This could result in more people gambling overall and lead to even more casino revenue.</p>
<p>At the moment, though, it’s difficult for casinos to capitalize on these opportunities because sports betting is illegal in most states. If the federal government were to legalize sports betting, it would give casinos a chance to tap into this new market and grow their revenue even more.</p>
