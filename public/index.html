He sat down at a table and revealed an Ace of Spades as his opening card. </p>
<p>The odds of being dealt an Ace as your first card in blackjack are 1 in 13, so Costa was feeling good about his chances of winning. The dealer then flipped over her next card- another Ace! </p>
<p>This gave Costa a total of 21, which is the best hand possible in blackjack. The dealer then drew a 3rd card, which gave her a total of 14. This meant that she had to hit, and she drew an 8, giving her a total of 22. </p>
<p>This meant that Costa won the hand with his 21, and he walked away from the table a very happy man!</p>

They have a long and storied history, mellow Mediterranean lifestyle, and some of the best blackjack players in the world. So it is no surprise that when Portugal exports its finest, the rest of the globe takes notice.</p>
<p>In recent years, Portuguese blackjack players have been tearing up casinos all over the world. From Monte Carlo to Macau, these players are leaving a trail of crushed chips in their wake. Part of their success comes from their aggressive playing style – they are not afraid to go all-in on a hand. But what really sets them apart is their unrivaled level of skill. These players know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em, which often leads to victory.</p>
<p>As Portugal’s blackjack reputation spreads throughout the international casino community, more and more casinos are vying for a chance to host these talented players. In fact, some casinos have even begun offering special incentives, such as luxury hotel rooms and expensive dinners, in an effort to woo them.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for some high-quality blackjack action, be sure to check out the casinos in Portugal. You won’t be disappointed!</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Dealer-Caught-Cheating-with-an-Ace-in-Portugal"><a href="#Blackjack-Dealer-Caught-Cheating-with-an-Ace-in-Portugal" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Dealer Caught Cheating with an Ace in Portugal"></a>Blackjack Dealer Caught Cheating with an Ace in Portugal</h1><p>A blackjack dealer in Portugal was recently caught cheating by using an ace to get an edge over players at the casino. </p>
<p>The incident took place at Casino Estoril, which is located in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon. The dealer, who has not been identified, allegedly used a card marked with an Ace to help him win games against players. </p>
<p>This is not the first time that cheating has been reported at Casino Estoril. Last year, two players were caught trying to use a mobile phone to help them win games. </p>
<p>Casino Estoril has reportedly launched an investigation into the latest cheating scandal, and the dealer involved has been suspended pending the outcome of that probe.</p>
<h1 id="Introducing-Portuguese-Blackjack-A-Game-for-All-Skill-Levels"><a href="#Introducing-Portuguese-Blackjack-A-Game-for-All-Skill-Levels" class="headerlink" title="Introducing Portuguese Blackjack: A Game for All Skill Levels"></a>Introducing Portuguese Blackjack: A Game for All Skill Levels</h1><p>Portuguese blackjack, also known as Pontoon, is a popular version of blackjack that originated in Portugal. The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards and has several different rules compared to other versions of the game. Portuguese blackjack can be enjoyed by players of all skill levels and is a great choice for those looking for a new casino game to play.</p>
<p>In Portuguese blackjack, the player is dealt two cards face-up and the dealer is dealt two cards, one face-up and one face-down. The player’s goal is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting closer to 21 than the dealer or by having a higher total value. In addition, players can also choose to “stand” (not receive any additional cards) or “draw” (receive another card) depending on their hand value.</p>
<p>The main difference between Portuguese blackjack and traditional blackjack is that in Portuguese blackjack, players can only double down on 9, 10, and 11. In addition, if both the player and dealer have 21 or less points after the first two cards are dealt, the hand ends in a tie (or “push”). This rule adds an extra layer of excitement to the game and makes it more challenging for players to achieve victory.</p>
<p>Portuguese blackjack can be played at online casinos that offer casino games from providers such as Playtech and Microgaming. These casinos offer a wide variety of games that can be enjoyed by players from around the world. In addition, most of these casinos offer generous bonuses and promotions that can be claimed by new players upon registration.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-is-Definitely-an-Ace-in-Portuguese-Blackjack"><a href="#How-Much-is-Definitely-an-Ace-in-Portuguese-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="How Much is Definitely an Ace in Portuguese Blackjack?"></a>How Much is Definitely an Ace in Portuguese Blackjack?</h1><p>In casinos around the world, blackjack is extremely popular. Yet not all variants of the game are created equal – and Portuguese blackjack is one such example. In this variant, players are dealt two cards and can either hit or stand depending on their hand total. The aim of the game is to reach 21, or get closer to 21 than the dealer without going bust.</p>
<p>Portuguese blackjack has a number of unique rules which can make the game more challenging for players. For instance, in some versions of the game dealers are allowed to hit on soft 17 (an Ace and 6), while in others they must stand on this total. Additionally, players cannot double down after splitting aces, and only receive one card when splitting pairs.</p>
<p>The upside of Portuguese blackjack is that it offers better odds for players than other variants of the game. For instance, the house edge is just 0.39% when playing perfect basic strategy – making it one of the most favourable games available in a casino. So if you’re looking for an enjoyable and relatively low-risk game to play, Portuguese blackjack is certainly worth considering!</p>

<p>Clinton has a lead in the polls, but her advantage is not as large as it once was. And Sanders has momentum after winning New Hampshire.</p>
<p>If turnout is high, Sanders could win. He has much more enthusiastic supporters than Clinton.</p>
<p>Clinton’s biggest advantage is that she is better organized and has more experience in running campaigns. She also has the backing of most of the Democratic Party establishment.</p>
<p>Sanders is appealing to young voters and independents, and he has strong support among liberals.</p>
<p>The big question is whether Sanders can attract enough support from black and Hispanic voters to win.</p>
<h1 id="Johnson-could-play-spoiler-in-tight-race"><a href="#Johnson-could-play-spoiler-in-tight-race" class="headerlink" title="Johnson could play spoiler in tight race"></a>Johnson could play spoiler in tight race</h1><p>Minnesota’s 3rd Congressional District is one of the most closely watched in the country, with incumbent Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson and Republican challenger Dave Hughes locked in a tight race.</p>
<p>But as the campaign enters its final days, a wildcard has emerged: Jeff Johnson, the Republican former governor who narrowly lost to Democrat Tim Walz in the 2018 race for governor.</p>
<p>A recent New York Times/Siena College poll shows that Johnson could play spoiler in the race, taking votes away from Hughes and helping Peterson win re-election.</p>
<p>The poll found that 19 percent of voters were undecided, and that Peterson had a 5-point lead over Hughes among those who said they were definitely going to vote. But when Johnson was included in the mix, Peterson’s lead shrinks to 2 points, with Hughes at 44 percent and Peterson at 42 percent.</p>
<p>Johnson insists he’s not running to help Peterson, but his presence in the race appears to be benefiting the incumbent congressman.</p>
<p>“I’m not trying to help Collin Peterson; I’m trying to beat Collin Peterson,” Johnson told reporters earlier this month. “But if people are so disillusioned with both parties that they either stay home or they vote for me, then I think that would be good for Minnesotans.”</p>
<p>Peterson has been in Congress since 1991, and is one of the most conservative Democrats in the House. He frequently breaks with his party on key issues, voting with Republicans on issues like gun rights and abortion.</p>
<p>Hughes has made it a priority to unseat Peterson, targeting the congressman’s record on spending and taxes. He has also criticized Peterson for not doing more to bring jobs to the district.</p>
<p>The 3rd Congressional District includes 10 counties in western Minnesota, including Minneapolis suburbs and rural areas near Lake Superior. It has been a Republican-leaning district in recent years, but Hughes faces an uphill battle against an incumbent who is popular among rural voters.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-gaining-on-Clinton-but-still-faces-long-odds"><a href="#Trump-gaining-on-Clinton-but-still-faces-long-odds" class="headerlink" title="Trump gaining on Clinton, but still faces long odds"></a>Trump gaining on Clinton, but still faces long odds</h1><blockquote>
<p>Despite a stream of bad news for Donald Trump in recent weeks, the Republican nominee has narrowed the gap with Hillary Clinton, but still faces long odds of winning the election in November, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The survey, released on Tuesday, showed that 42 percent of likely voters supported Clinton while 38 percent backed Trump. Clinton has held a comfortable lead in the polls for months, but Trump has been drawing more support from Republicans in recent weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The poll also found that about 22 percent of likely voters said they would not support either candidate. That figure was down from about 30 percent earlier this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>James Henson, director of the University of Texas’ Texas Politics Project, said Trump’s rise in the polls since early August was due largely to Republicans coming home to their party nominee.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The reason he’s narrowed it is because people have decided that they don’t like either one of these candidates but they like Trump less bad than they like Hillary,” Henson said.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="New-poll-shows-dead-heat-in-Pennsylvania"><a href="#New-poll-shows-dead-heat-in-Pennsylvania" class="headerlink" title="New poll shows dead heat in Pennsylvania"></a>New poll shows dead heat in Pennsylvania</h1><p>.</p>
<p>A new poll released by Franklin and Marshall College on Wednesday shows Republican Gov. Tom Corbett and Democratic challenger Tom Wolf in a dead heat, with each receiving the support of 46 percent of registered voters.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The poll’s margin of error is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points, meaning that the two candidates are essentially statistically tied.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>“This race is still up for grabs,” said G. Terry Madonna, Ph.D., director of Franklin &amp; Marshall’s Keystone Polling Service and professor of public affairs at the college. “Governor Corbett has not broken 50 percent yet and he has a lot of work to do between now and November.”</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Corbett’s poor approval ratings — only 38 percent approve of the job he is doing as governor, while 55 percent disapprove — may be working against him, Madonna said. Wolf’s favorability ratings are also underwater, but not as badly as Corbett’s: 37 percent view him favorably, while 31 percent have an unfavorable opinion.</p>
<h1 id="Five-key-states-to-watch-on-Election-Day"><a href="#Five-key-states-to-watch-on-Election-Day" class="headerlink" title="Five key states to watch on Election Day"></a>Five key states to watch on Election Day</h1><p>As Americans head to the polls to cast their ballots in the 2018 midterm elections, here are five key states to watch.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Texas: The state has been a Republican stronghold for years, but Democrats are hoping to make inroads in the Lone Star State this year. The race between incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke is one of the most closely watched contests in the country.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Georgia: Like Texas, Georgia has been a Republican stronghold in recent years. However, Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams could be on track to become the first black female governor in the United States if she wins on Tuesday.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pennsylvania: The race for Pennsylvania’s 18th district is one of the most closely watched House races in the country. The seat became vacant after longtime Republican incumbent Tim Murphy resigned following allegations that he had an extramarital affair. Democrat Conor Lamb and Republican Rick Saccone are battling it out for the seat.</p>
</li>
<li><p>California: With all 53 seats up for grabs, California is a key battleground state in the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats are looking to win back control of the House of Representatives by picking up as many seats as possible in California.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Minnesota: Although it is typically a blue state, Minnesota is seen as a toss-up state this year. The race between incumbent Democratic Senator Tina Smith and her Republican challenger Karin Housley is one to watch on Election Day.</p>
</li>
</ol>

        <h1 id="Why-Do-Chinese-People-Point-Out-Monkey-When-Gambling"><a href="#Why-Do-Chinese-People-Point-Out-Monkey-When-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Why Do Chinese People Point Out Monkey When Gambling?"></a>Why Do Chinese People Point Out Monkey When Gambling?</h1><p>The Monkey is one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac calendar. People who are born in the year of the monkey (1932, 1944, 1956, 1968, 1980, 1992, 2004) are considered intelligent, flexible and versatile.</p>
<p>According to Chinese legend, the god of luck and prosperity named “Fu Lu Shou” was on his way to a party with three other gods when they encountered a group of monkeys blocking their path. The god Fu Lu Shou managed to make all the monkeys disappear and continued on his way to the party.</p>
<p>In honor of this story, people who are born in the year of the monkey are supposed to bring good luck and prosperity to those around them. This is why you often see Chinese people pointing out the monkey when gambling – they believe it will bring them good luck.</p>
<h1 id="The-Significance-of-Pointing-Out-the-Monkey-in-Gambling"><a href="#The-Significance-of-Pointing-Out-the-Monkey-in-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="The Significance of Pointing Out the Monkey in Gambling"></a>The Significance of Pointing Out the Monkey in Gambling</h1><p>It has been said that those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. In the world of gambling, it is important for players to be aware of the significant lessons from the past in order to make informed decisions that can lead to profits.</p>
<p>A prime example of this is the story of the monkey. Way back in 1892, a horse named George Smith was racing at a track in New Orleans when a monkey jumped into the race and grabbed the horse’s jockey’s whip. The whip snapped Smith out of his concentration, and he lost the race.</p>
<p>While there is no clear evidence that this story is true, it has become an infamous gambling legend. The moral of the story is that even the slightest disruption can ruin your chances of winning - something that players should keep in mind when they’re betting on races or other sporting events.</p>
<p>In particular, punters need to be wary of outside factors such as weather conditions and injuries that could affect how a game unfolds. For example, if you’re betting on a football match and one team is missing their best player, that’s something you’ll need to take into account when making your predictions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you also need to be mindful of the fact that bookmakers often try to bias public opinion by setting odds that favour one side over another. This is why it’s important to do your own research before placing any bets - otherwise you might find yourself getting caught up in all the hype and losing money in the process.</p>
<p>Of course, no one can predict with 100% certainty how a game will play out, but by being aware of the monkey in gambling, you’ll be well on your way to making more informed bets and improving your chances of winning.</p>
<h1 id="Monkey-is-the-God-of-Luck-in-China"><a href="#Monkey-is-the-God-of-Luck-in-China" class="headerlink" title="Monkey is the God of Luck in China"></a>Monkey is the God of Luck in China</h1><p>The monkey is one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac. For many Chinese people, the monkey is not only a cute animal, but also the god of luck.</p>
<p>There are many legends about monkeys and luck. One story goes that a man had a terrible disease and no one could cure him. He went to a temple and prayed to the god of the temple for help. Suddenly, a monkey appeared and stole a medicine from the god’s altar. The man followed the monkey and recovered his health.</p>
<p>Another story tells of a poor farmer who had no money to pay his taxes. He prayed to the god of luck, and soon a monkey brought him some treasure. The farmer was able to pay his taxes and keep his farm.</p>
<p>Monkeys are said to be lucky because they are intelligent and agile, and they often find food in difficult places. In China, there are many statues and images of monkeys because people believe that they bring good luck.</p>
<h1 id="Why-do-Chinese-people-believe-that-Monkey-brings-them-good-luck"><a href="#Why-do-Chinese-people-believe-that-Monkey-brings-them-good-luck" class="headerlink" title="Why do Chinese people believe that Monkey brings them good luck?"></a>Why do Chinese people believe that Monkey brings them good luck?</h1><p>There is an old saying in China that goes, “Monkey brings good luck.” 佬莎猴喜 (lǎoshā hóu xǐ), which literally means “Monkey brings happiness.” </p>
<p>This expression comes from an ancient Chinese legend about a monkey who was said to have the power to bring good luck. </p>
<p>The story goes that a long time ago, there was a village that suffered from a series of bad luck. The villagers were so desperate that they prayed to the gods for help. </p>
<p>Suddenly, a magical monkey appeared and promised to help them. The monkey told the villagers that he could banish all of the bad luck if they would make him their king. </p>
<p>The villagers were so happy to have their good luck returned that they agreed to make the monkey their king. And from then on, the people of the village believed that Monkey brought them good luck. </p>
<p>Today, many Chinese people still believe that Monkey brings them good luck. This is because Monkey is seen as a symbol of happiness and good fortune.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Gamblers-Boost-their-Luck-by-Pointing-Out-the-Monkey"><a href="#How-to-Gamblers-Boost-their-Luck-by-Pointing-Out-the-Monkey" class="headerlink" title="How to Gamblers Boost their Luck by Pointing Out the Monkey"></a>How to Gamblers Boost their Luck by Pointing Out the Monkey</h1><p>A recent study out of Nottingham Trent University found that when gamblers pointed out a monkey to another person at the casino, their luck improved.<br>This is the first study of its kind to document this phenomenon.</p>
<p>The study participants were asked to play a game of chance while being watched by a researcher. They were also videotaped during their play. In some cases, the researcher pointed out a toy monkey that was placed in the playing area. In other cases, the toy monkey was not mentioned.</p>
<p>The results showed that when the toy monkey was pointed out, the players’ odds of winning increased significantly. Therefore, it would appear that pointing out the monkey can help boost your luck while gambling.</p>
<p>So what could be behind this strange finding? One possible explanation is that seeing the toy monkey triggers something in our brains that makes us more likely to win. It may also be due to superstition – we may think that because we noticed the monkey, it must be good luck.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, if you want to gamble and want to give yourself a better chance of winning, point out the monkey!</p>

With this growth, there has also been an increased demand for gambling sites that cater to Esports fans. So how do you choose the best CSGO gambling site?</p>
<p>When looking for a CSGO gambling site, it’s important to consider a few factors. The first factor to consider is the types of bets that are offered on the site. Some sites only offer basic bets, such as heads-up, while others offer more complex bets, such as betting on map outcomes.</p>

In fact, according to a 2013 article by the Huffington Post, an estimated $380 billion is wagered on sports each year in the U.S. This number is only expected to grow as more and more states legalize gambling.</p>
<p>Clearly, Americans enjoy betting on sports, so why not make it legal? Legalizing sports betting would bring substantial benefits to states and their residents.</p>
<p>First, legalizing sports betting would create jobs. According to a 2017 study by Oxford Economics, legalizing sports betting in New Jersey could create up to 3,000 jobs in the state. These jobs would include everything from casino workers to software developers to marketing experts.</p>
<p>Second, legalizing sports betting would generate significant revenue for states. A study by Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming found that if Delaware were to legalize sports betting, it could bring in an additional $25 million in tax revenue each year. This money could be used for everything from education funding to infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p>Third, legalizing sports betting would boost tourism. In addition to creating jobs and generating revenue, legalizing sports betting would attract tourists to states that have legalized gambling. This increased tourism would benefit local businesses and create even more jobs.</p>
<p>Finally, legalizing sports betting is the right thing to do. Gambling is already happening illegally throughout the country, so why not regulate it and tax it? This would bring in much-needed revenue for states while also protecting consumers by ensuring that gambling is conducted responsibly and fairly.</p>
<p>Legalizing sports betting is a win-win-win proposition for states and their residents. It would create jobs, generate revenue, and boost tourism – all while being fair and responsible for consumers. It’s time for states to legalize this popular pastime!</p>

But what you may not know is that casinos are also a great place to find a job. In fact, the casino industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the economy.</p>
<p>Now, a new casino is hoping to open in your area. This casino is different than any other casino in the area, though. It’s a sports casino. What’s a sports casino? It’s a casino that specializes in sports betting.</p>
<p>This new sports casino would create jobs for recent graduates. These jobs would be perfect for recent graduates because they would allow them to get experience in the casino industry while they continue their education.</p>
<p>The sports casino would also create jobs for experienced professionals. These jobs would be perfect for experienced professionals because they would allow them to use their skills and knowledge in the casino industry.</p>
<p>The sports casino would be a great place for people who love sports betting. In addition to gambling on sporting events, people could also enjoy watching those events on big screens while they drink and eat at the casino’s restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>The sports casino would be a great place for people who love to gamble. In addition to gambling on sporting events, people could also enjoy playing blackjack, roulette, and other popular casino games at the sports casino.</p>
<p>So, what do you think? Are you interested in the idea of a sports casino? If so, please share this article with your friends and family members who might also be interested in this new type of casino.</p>
<h1 id="Why-shouldn’t-Americans-be-able-to-bet-on-their-favourite-sports"><a href="#Why-shouldn’t-Americans-be-able-to-bet-on-their-favourite-sports" class="headerlink" title="Why shouldn’t Americans be able to bet on their favourite sports?"></a>Why shouldn’t Americans be able to bet on their favourite sports?</h1><p>There is a lot of talk in the United States about the legalization of sports betting. This is a topic that has been debated for many years, and it does not seem like there is a clear answer. Some people are in favour of it, while others are against it. There are pros and cons to both arguments, but in the end, it is up to the individual to make their own decision.</p>
<p>Those who are in favour of legalizing sports betting argue that it would bring in much-needed revenue to states. They also say that it would create jobs, and that it would be a good way to keep people interested in sports. Those who are against sports betting say that it would promote gambling addiction, and that it could lead to corruption in the sporting world.</p>
<p>Personally, I am in favour of legalizing sports betting. I think that it would be beneficial for states, and that it would be a good way to keep people interested in sports. I understand the concerns that some people have about gambling addiction and corruption, but I believe that those things can be controlled. Overall, I think that legalizing sports betting would be a positive thing for the United States.</p>
<h1 id="Legal-sports-casino-would-be-great-for-the-economy"><a href="#Legal-sports-casino-would-be-great-for-the-economy" class="headerlink" title="Legal sports casino would be great for the economy!"></a>Legal sports casino would be great for the economy!</h1><p>The legalization of sport betting in the United States would be great for the economy. It would create thousands of new jobs, and generate billions of dollars in tax revenue.</p>
<p>There is a lot of money to be made in the sports betting industry. In fact, it is estimated that Americans bet over $150 billion on sports each year. But all of that money is currently being bet illegally, because sports betting is currently illegal in most states.</p>
<p>If sports betting were to be legalized, it would create a new industry that would generate thousands of jobs. There would be jobs for bookmakers, analysts, customer service representatives, and many others. In addition, the government would collect billions of dollars in tax revenue from the industry.</p>
<p>Most people believe that legalizing sports betting would benefit the economy overall. A recent poll found that 71% of Americans believe that legalizing sports betting would be good for the economy. And it’s not just Americans who think this way. Recent polls in other countries where sports betting is already legal have found that a majority of people think it is good for the economy.</p>
<p>Legalizing sports betting is a win-win proposition for everyone involved. It would create jobs and generate tax revenue for the government, while also giving people a safe and legal way to place bets on their favorite sporting events.</p>
<h1 id="Let’s-legalize-sports-casino-and-bring-in-the-revenue"><a href="#Let’s-legalize-sports-casino-and-bring-in-the-revenue" class="headerlink" title="Let’s legalize sports casino and bring in the revenue!"></a>Let’s legalize sports casino and bring in the revenue!</h1><p>It’s no secret that casino gaming is a multi-billion dollar industry. And while some forms of casino gambling, like online poker, are legal in some parts of the United States, other types of casino games are not. One such game is sports betting, which is currently illegal in all 50 states. But that may be about to change.</p>
<p>A number of states have been moving to legalize sports betting in recent months, and it seems likely that this trend will continue. The main reason for this is the fact that sports betting brings in a lot of revenue. In fact, a recent study found that legalizing sports betting could bring in as much as $26 billion in new revenue over the next decade. This would be a huge boon to state governments, which are constantly struggling to find new sources of revenue.</p>
<p>So why hasn’t sports betting been legalized yet? The main reason is that there is a lot of resistance from the NFL and other professional sports leagues. They argue that legalizing sports betting would compromise the integrity of their games. But many experts disagree with this assessment, and say that the leagues have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>In any case, it seems likely that legalized sports betting will eventually become a reality in the United States. When it does, casinos will be poised to reap the benefits. So if you’re looking for a profitable investment, look no further than the casino gaming industry!</p>

Employers are always on the lookout for developers with Ruby skills, and with a median salary of $128,000, there’s plenty of reasons to learn this powerful programming language.</p>
<p>If you’re new to Ruby (or programming in general), don’t worry - we’re going to walk you through everything you need to get started. By the end of this article, you’ll be able to create your own simple Ruby programs, and you’ll have a basic understanding of how Ruby works.</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<h1 id="What-is-Ruby"><a href="#What-is-Ruby" class="headerlink" title="What is Ruby?"></a>What is Ruby?</h1><p>Ruby is a powerful programming language that was first released in 1995. It quickly gained popularity due to its ease of use and readability, making it perfect for beginners. Ruby is an object-oriented language, which means that everything in Ruby is treated as an object. This makes Ruby code easy to read and understand.</p>
<p>Ruby also has a number of built-in features that make it perfect for web development. For example, it has a built-in HTML parser which makes it easy to generate HTML pages from within your Ruby code. It also supports server-side scripting, making it perfect for creating dynamic web applications.</p>
<h1 id="Installing-Ruby"><a href="#Installing-Ruby" class="headerlink" title="Installing Ruby"></a>Installing Ruby</h1><p>The best way to learn Ruby is by using a coding environment called rubymine. This is a free software package that includes all the tools you need to develop ruby applications. You can download rubymine from the official ruby website: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/</a> .</p>
<p>Once you’ve installed rubymine, open it up and you’ll see a screen like this:</p>
<pre><code>                       We&#39;ll be using this screen throughout this tutorial - each time we run a new program or execute a command, we&#39;ll show you what it looks like inside rubymine. The first thing we need to do is install the ruby interpreter on our computer. To do this, open up your terminal (or command prompt) and type the following command: sudo apt install ruby-devOnce ruby is installed, we can start writing our first program!

<p>If you’re hiding your gambling from family and friends, then it may be because you’re ashamed of your addiction. Gambling can be a very secretive addiction, and many people who are addicted to gambling will go out of their way to keep it hidden from others.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You feel anxious or depressed when you can’t gamble</li>
</ol>
<p>If you feel anxious or depressed when you can’t gamble, then this is another sign that you may be addicted. When you’re unable to gamble, you may feel like there’s something missing in your life and this can lead to feelings of anxiety or depression.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>You lie about your gambling habit</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find yourself lying about your gambling habit, then this is another sign that you may be addicted. Lying about how much money you’ve spent on gambling or hiding your gambling habit from others is not healthy and is often a sign that there is a problem.</p>

In fact, there are certain behaviors and patterns of behavior that are common in people who have a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>One sign of a gambling addiction is that the person will often times gamble more than they can afford to lose. They may also gamble even when they know they are going to lose money. Gambling addicts often have a “gambling problem” and will continue to gamble, even when it causes them financial, personal or relationship problems.</p>
<p>Other telltale signs of a gambling addiction include: being secretive about gambling activities, borrowing money from friends or family to gamble, lying about gambling losses, and feeling anxious or stressed when not able to gamble.</p>

        <h1 id="Maryland-Proposes-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Maryland-Proposes-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Proposes Online Gambling"></a>Maryland Proposes Online Gambling</h1><p>The state of Maryland has been in the news a lot lately, with proposals for new gambling initiatives. First, there was a proposal to expand casino gambling to include table games and a new location. Then, a proposal was made to legalize and regulate online gambling within the state.</p>
<p>This is big news for the state of Maryland, as well as for online gamblers throughout the country. If the proposal is passed, it will make Maryland one of the few states to legalize online gambling. It will also allow Maryland casinos to compete with casinos in other states that have already legalized online gambling.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to legalizing online gambling. For starters, it will generate revenue for the state government. It is also expected to create jobs, as well as bring new business to Maryland casinos. In addition, legalizing online gambling could help reduce crime in the state by providing an alternative form of entertainment for those who might otherwise participate in criminal activities.</p>
<p>There are some opponents of the proposal, who argue that it could lead to addiction and other negative consequences. However, proponents say that these risks can be mitigated by regulating and policing the industry properly.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether or not the proposal will be passed by the state legislature. However, if it is approved, it could have a major impact on the gambling landscape in Maryland and nationwide.</p>
<h1 id="Governor-O’Malley-Proposes-Casino-Expansion-in-Maryland"><a href="#Governor-O’Malley-Proposes-Casino-Expansion-in-Maryland" class="headerlink" title="Governor O’Malley Proposes Casino Expansion in Maryland"></a>Governor O’Malley Proposes Casino Expansion in Maryland</h1><p>Governor Martin O’Malley of Maryland recently proposed a bill that would legalize casino gambling in the state. The proposal calls for five new casinos to be built, as well as a lottery terminal facility at each of the state’s four horse tracks. If passed, the measure is expected to generate $500 million in annual revenue for Maryland. </p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will result in an increase in crime and gambling addiction, while supporters say it will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to the state. Governor O’Malley has been a strong advocate of casino expansion in the past, and this latest proposal is seen as his last chance to make it happen before he leaves office next year. </p>
<p>Maryland is one of only a few states that does not have any legalized gambling, and its residents currently travel to other states to participate in casino games. If the bill passes, those residents will soon have access to casinos closer to home.</p>
<h1 id="Could-Legalized-Online-Gambling-be-Coming-to-Maryland"><a href="#Could-Legalized-Online-Gambling-be-Coming-to-Maryland" class="headerlink" title="Could Legalized Online Gambling be Coming to Maryland?"></a>Could Legalized Online Gambling be Coming to Maryland?</h1><p>Maryland is one of the few states in the US that does not have legalized gambling of any form. This could be about to change, as there is growing pressure for the state to legalize online gambling.</p>
<p>Sponsored by MGM Resorts International, a bill was recently introduced in Maryland to legalize online gambling. The company is hoping that the introduction of this bill will prompt other states to do the same, as it would create a larger market for them.</p>
<p>There are many people who are in favor of legalizing online gambling in Maryland. These people believe that it would bring much-needed revenue to the state, and that it would also create jobs. They argue that it is time for Maryland to join the rest of the country in legalizing this type of gambling.</p>
<p>However, there are also those who are opposed to legalizing online gambling in Maryland. These people argue that it is too risky, and that there is no way to ensure that minors will not be able to access these websites. They also argue that gambling can be addictive, and that it can lead to financial problems for those who participate in it.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether or not online gambling will be legalized in Maryland. However, with pressure mounting on the state to do so, it seems likely that something will eventually give.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-Governor-Proposes-Bill-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Maryland-Governor-Proposes-Bill-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Governor Proposes Bill to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>Maryland Governor Proposes Bill to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>Governor of Maryland, Martin O’Malley, has recently announced his plan to legalize and regulate internet gambling in the state. This move could prove lucrative for the state as it would bring in an estimated $200 million in annual revenue. In addition, the proposed bill would help to create new jobs and protect players from fraud and other risks associated with online gambling.</p>
<p>This would be a major shift in policy for Maryland, which currently does not allow any form of gambling except for lottery games and horse racing. If passed, the new law would allow residents over the age of 21 to gamble on casino games, poker, and other types of betting through approved websites. The proposed bill sets strict regulations for operators, requiring them to pay a licensing fee and adhere to responsible gambling guidelines.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it would provide much-needed revenue for the state while also creating jobs in the gaming industry. They point out that online gambling is already popular in Maryland, with many residents participating in illegal betting operations. By legalizing and regulating the activity, the state could better protect players and ensure that revenues are generated legally.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction and other social problems. They also claim that the state could earn more revenue by expanding its current lottery program rather than legalizing online gambling.</p>
<p>The proposed bill is currently being reviewed by a legislative committee and is expected to face a difficult battle in the legislature.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-Gov-Martin-O’Malley-Introduces-Bill-to-Legalize-Online-Gaming"><a href="#Maryland-Gov-Martin-O’Malley-Introduces-Bill-to-Legalize-Online-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley Introduces Bill to Legalize Online Gaming"></a>Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley Introduces Bill to Legalize Online Gaming</h1><p>Governor of Maryland and 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate, Martin O’Malley introduced a bill on Wednesday to legalize and regulate online gaming in the state.</p>
<p>If passed, the law would allow residents of Maryland over 21 years of age to gamble on casino games, poker, and other betting activities through their computer or mobile device. The Maryland Lottery and Gaming Commission would be responsible for regulating the industry and issuing licenses to casinos and gaming operators.</p>
<p>“It is time for Maryland to join the rest of the country in legalizing and regulating online gaming,” Governor O’Malley said in a statement. “This legislation will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to our state.”</p>
<p>The bill is estimated to generate $13 million in annual tax revenue for Maryland, as well as create 1,000 new jobs in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Opposition to the bill is likely to come from religious groups and anti-gambling activists who argue that online gaming is addictive and can lead to financial ruin. But Governor O’Malley believes that it is better to have regulated gambling than illegal gambling operations which can be more dangerous.</p>
<p>“Maryland has been a leader in creating safe and responsible gambling options,” he said. “This legislation builds on our successful track record while ensuring that gamer are protected.”</p>
<p>It is not yet clear whether the bill will pass, but with Democratic majorities in both chambers of the legislature, it has a good chance.</p>

        <h1 id="Bettors-Swarm-Vegas-Sportsbooks-for-the-NFL-Opener"><a href="#Bettors-Swarm-Vegas-Sportsbooks-for-the-NFL-Opener" class="headerlink" title="Bettors Swarm Vegas Sportsbooks for the NFL Opener"></a>Bettors Swarm Vegas Sportsbooks for the NFL Opener</h1><p>The National Football League’s 2017-2018 season began on September 6 with a clash between the reigning Super Bowl champions, the New England Patriots, and the Kansas City Chiefs. And while the game may have been a blowout (the Pats won 42-27), it was nonetheless a popular one at Nevada’s sportsbooks.</p>
<p>According to figures released by the Gaming Control Board, bettors wagered a total of $158.5 million on NFL games in September, setting a new record for monthly betting volume. The figure was up from $149.8 million wagered in September of last year, and represented a 10 percent increase over the previous high mark of $143.5 million set in March of this year.</p>
<p>Football is easily the most popular sport for betting in the United States, and interest in this year’s NFL season has been especially high due to the excitement surrounding some of the league’s marquee teams (e.g., the Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers). In addition, there are several new head coaches this season (including Jon Gruden with the Raiders and Matt Patricia with the Lions), giving bettors additional opportunities to make informed wagers.</p>
<p>The jump in betting volume was seen across all segments of Nevada’s sports betting market. In terms of amounts wagered, football accounted for 36 percent of all bets placed on sports in September; basketball was second at 17 percent, while baseball came in third at 14 percent. And when it comes to individual sportsbooks, Caesar’s Palace took in the most money ($32.9 million) thanks largely to its large number of football betting options, including point spreads, totals, and moneylines.</p>
<h1 id="How-Sports-Gambling-is-Affecting-the-Las-Vegas-Casino-Industry"><a href="#How-Sports-Gambling-is-Affecting-the-Las-Vegas-Casino-Industry" class="headerlink" title="How Sports Gambling is Affecting the Las Vegas Casino Industry"></a>How Sports Gambling is Affecting the Las Vegas Casino Industry</h1><p>The casino industry in Las Vegas is facing an uncertain future as the legalization of sports gambling nationwide threatens to take a massive bite out of their profits. With Las Vegas already struggling to compete with other destinations in the face of declining tourism, the impact of legalized sports gambling could be devastating.</p>
<p>Casinos have long benefited from the prohibition on sports betting, as it has forced gamblers to turn to them as their only option for placing wagers. This has allowed casinos to charge high fees and offer poor odds, which has resulted in billion-dollar profits. But with sports gambling now legal in most states, casino operators are concerned that many of these gamblers will choose to place their bets elsewhere.</p>
<p>This is already beginning to happen, as more and more states legalize sports betting. In New Jersey, for example, casino revenue declined by 3.6% in 2018, largely due to the rise of online sports gambling. Nevada, meanwhile, saw its casino revenue decline by 2.5% in 2018, with experts predicting that the trend will continue going forward.</p>
<p>This threatens to have a particularly significant impact on Las Vegas, which has reaped the benefits of legalized gambling more than any other city in America. The city’s casinos generated nearly $250 million in revenue from sports betting in 2017, accounting for more than one-third of all such revenue nationwide. If this figure begins to decline significantly, it could be a major blow to the city’s economy.</p>
<p>Casino operators are hoping that they can stem this tide by getting involved in the sports betting industry themselves. But this is likely to be a challenging proposition, as online betting companies have a significant head start and are well-equipped to handle the increased demand. Casino operators may also find themselves playing catch-up when it comes to regulation and compliance, which could add further costs and complexity to their operations.</p>
<p>In light of all this uncertainty, casino operators are preparing for a future where sports betting takes a significant chunk out of their profits. This may mean scaling back their investments in Las Vegas or even abandoning the city entirely. Whatever happens, it is clear that legalized sports gambling represents a major threat to the Las Vegas casino industry</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Gamble-on-Sports-and-Win"><a href="#How-to-Gamble-on-Sports-and-Win" class="headerlink" title="How to Gamble on Sports and Win"></a>How to Gamble on Sports and Win</h1><p>Betting on sports is one of the most popular forms of gambling. In fact, in some countries like the UK, it is considered a national pastime. But there are a lot of people who make this form of gambling much more difficult than it needs to be. Just like any other form of gambling, if you know what you’re doing and make smart bets, you can make a lot of money.</p>
<p>The key to successful sports betting is to find value in the odds. This means finding bets where the odds are skewed in your favour - even if by just a little bit. There are a few different ways to do this. </p>
<p>One way is to bet on matchups between teams that are evenly matched. In these cases, the odds are often close to 50/50, so finding bets with good value can be tricky. However, if you do your research and know which team is likely to win, you can make a lot of money by betting against them at better-than-even odds. </p>
<p>Another way to find good value bets is by looking at underdogs. In most cases, the odds for an underdog winning are significantly higher than they should be. So if you have a feeling that an underdog is going to pull off an upset, this is a great way to get good value on your bet. </p>
<p>Of course, nothing is guaranteed in life, including sports betting. But if you follow these tips and play smart, you stand a much better chance of making money rather than losing it.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Sports-Books-Facing-Uncertain-Future-in-the-Age-of-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Sports-Books-Facing-Uncertain-Future-in-the-Age-of-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Sports Books Facing Uncertain Future in the Age of Online Gambling"></a>Nevada Sports Books Facing Uncertain Future in the Age of Online Gambling</h1><p>Just a few years ago, the Nevada sports book industry was thriving. However, in the age of online gambling, that is no longer the case.</p>
<p>The amount of money wagered on sports in Nevada has steadily decreased over the past few years. In 2016, sports betting revenues totaled just $2.34 billion, down from a high of $3.6 billion in 2007.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this decline is the fact that many people are now choosing to gamble online instead of going to a casino or sports book. This is due to the convenience and ease of online gambling, as well as the fact that it often offers better odds than traditional sports betting.</p>
<p>As a result, many Nevada casinos and sports books are struggling financially. This was made evident earlier this year when Wynn Resorts announced it was closing its sports book at its Las Vegas property.</p>
<p>While there is still money to be made in the Nevada sports book industry, it is clear that it is no longer as lucrative as it once was. This could lead more casinos and sports books to close their doors in the coming years.</p>
<h1 id="Can-Casinos-Survive-Without-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Can-Casinos-Survive-Without-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Can Casinos Survive Without Sports Betting?"></a>Can Casinos Survive Without Sports Betting?</h1><p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) recently released a report that shows casino revenue from sports betting has increased from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $2.9 billion in 2018. This is a 155% increase in just one year. In order to put this number into perspective, casino revenue from all other forms of gambling only increased by 7%. With this kind of growth, it’s no wonder the AGA is pushing for the legalization of sports betting on a federal level.</p>
<p>But will casinos be able to maintain this level of growth without sports betting?</p>
<p>It’s doubtful.</p>
<p> legalized sports betting can create an entirely new market for casinos. For example, the AGA report cites that there are 33 million Americans who identify as “occasional bettors”. These are people who only bet on one or two sporting events per year. If casinos can get these people to start betting more often, they would see a significant increase in revenue.</p>
<p>In addition, many people only bet on major sporting events, like the Super Bowl or March Madness. This leaves the door open for casinos to offer prop bets and other wagers on smaller sporting events that people might not normally bet on. This could result in more people gambling overall and lead to even more casino revenue.</p>
<p>At the moment, though, it’s difficult for casinos to capitalize on these opportunities because sports betting is illegal in most states. If the federal government were to legalize sports betting, it would give casinos a chance to tap into this new market and grow their revenue even more.</p>

<p>Reynolds, who is from Brooklyn, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen to two years and nine months in prison. He was also ordered to pay a $2,000 fine.</p>
<p>Reynolds had pleaded guilty in March to conspiring to operate an illegal gambling business.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say Reynolds was part of a gambling ring that took sports bets online and over the phone.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys had asked for leniency, saying Reynolds was not the mastermind of the scheme and had cooperated with investigators.</p>

Reynolds, who had previously served as the mayor of Tallahassee from 1998 to 2003, was found guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and unlawful Internet gambling in February after being indicted in connection with an illegal online gambling operation.</p>
<p>Reynolds was sentenced to 33 months in prison on Monday, with federal prosecutors arguing that he should receive a longer sentence due to his “position of public trust.” However, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Hinkle ultimately decided on a shorter sentence, noting that Reynolds had no prior criminal record and had already suffered professionally as a result of the case. In addition to his prison sentence, Reynolds was also ordered to pay $200,000 in restitution.</p>
<p>The 61-year-old Reynolds is the latest high-profile figure to be convicted as part of the government’s crackdown on illegal online gambling. Other defendants in the case include Gilbert Chilton, the owner of offshore sports betting site BetOnSports, who was sentenced to seven years in prison last year.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for the pain and embarrassment I’ve caused,” Reynolds said in a statement. “I know I’ve let down the people who have supported me for years. I’m committed to making things right and will work with the city to ensure that this doesn’t happen again.”</p>
<p>Reynolds, known for his involvement in youth athletics and charity work, was arrested last month as part of a sweeping investigation into illegal gambling in the city. He is one of more than two dozen people charged in connection with the probe.</p>
<p>Reynolds admitted to betting on college and pro games, but said he never placed bets with bookies or against his own teams.</p>
<p>“I know I made a mistake and I take full responsibility for my actions,” Reynolds said. “I hope that through my actions I can show others that there are better ways to deal with problems than through gambling.”</p>
<p>Reynolds attorney said his client looks forward to putting this behind him and moving on with his life.</p>

<p>Reynolds was found guilty on one count of bookmaking and five counts of promoting a lottery. He was sentenced to three years probation and must pay a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>In a statement released to the Tallahassee Democrat, Reynolds said, “I want to apologize to the citizens of Tallahassee for my actions that have led to this conviction. I take full responsibility for my conduct and I am deeply sorry for the harm that I have caused. I look forward to putting this incident behind me and continuing to serve the city that I love.”</p>
<p>Tallahassee City Manager Reese Goad said in a statement, “The City Commission is committed to holding its elected officials accountable for their actions, and we are confident that the judicial process will run its course. In the meantime, Mayor Pro-Tem Curtis Richardson will continue to lead the city in an effective and orderly manner.”</p>
<p>Reynolds was first elected to the Tallahassee City Commission in 2003 and served as mayor from 2010-2012. He did not seek reelection in 2012 after his gambling arrest.</p>

How was Reynolds able to get away with such a serious crime for so long? What other secrets is he hiding?</p>
<p>Reynolds has always been a controversial figure, and there have been rumors of corruption floating around him for years. His gambling conviction is only going to add fuel to the fire. There are many people who are now calling for his resignation, and some are even calling for him to be arrested and put on trial.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Reynolds is not fit to be in office. He has shown himself to be nothing but a criminal and a liar. The people of this country deserve better than that. It’s time for Reynolds to step down and let someone else take over.</p>
